1. Want to deploy python application on Azure Function or on Azure app service
2. Backend is on superbase (Nothing rquired here)
3. Need to deploy Frontend but not clear it is STATIC or DYNAMIC
if STATIC -> we can do it by bucket or CDN 
if Dynamic -> we need to create VM 

they have 2 services, one AI application which they want to deploy on Azure function and other frontend which they I am not sure if its static so I told her to connect with utkarsh and confirm the same. Once confirmed I can give her access to those specific azure services wiith vijay sir's approval.
